# 🐜 Antillery

_A Unity-based 2D artillery game where ants wage war (and peace)._

Antillery is a turn-based local multiplayer game inspired by the satirical chaos of the *Worms* franchise — but with a twist. In Antillery, your weapons aren't just explosives. They're wildflowers, sod rolls, and butterfly clouds. It's strategy without a fixed form: every match is shaped by destruction **and** restoration.

This project is the culmination of a solo senior Computer Science capstone, with a focus on modular architecture, system extensibility, and intentional absurdity.

## 🎮 Core Features

- 🧨 **Physics-based turn combat**  
  Launch projectiles influenced by gravity, wind, and terrain deformation.

- 🧠 **Peace tools that disrupt**  
  Plant sunflowers, roll sod, and deploy butterflies — all can block, trap, or deflect.

- 🌍 **Destructible + constructible terrain**  
  The battlefield evolves dynamically as tools alter the terrain in real time.

- 👥 **Couch multiplayer (2–4 players)**  
  Play on a single device with your friends.

- 🧩 **Modular tool system**  
  Tools defined via ScriptableObjects, supporting customization and future expansion.

- 🎯 **Unity Input System integration**  
  Scalable player input abstraction supporting keyboards, gamepads, and more.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Unity
- C# (modular, testable architecture)
- Unity Input System
- ScriptableObjects for data-driven design
- 2D alpha mask terrain with real-time modification
- Custom dev tooling (standalone map generator, tool selector, debug overlays)

## 🧱 Development Context

This project is a solo-developed Computer Science capstone from California State University, Fullerton. It reflects a blend of traditional game dev, systems architecture, and tongue-in-cheek genre subversion.

While inspired by legacy artillery titles, Antillery is not a clone, it’s an evolution. Tools of peace can create just as much chaos as tools of war.
